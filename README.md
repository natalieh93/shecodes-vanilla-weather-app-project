<strong>Weather App</strong>

This weather app was a project for the <strong>“Plus” workshop</strong> from <strong>SheCodes</strong> and utilizes the <strong>API</strong> from <strong>openweathermap.org</strong> to extract weather data. It provides the current weather, a 3-hour weather forecast as well as a 5-day outlook for the selected or searched city, and for a user’s current geolocation.

It is hosted on <strong>Netlify</strong> and can be viewed here:
